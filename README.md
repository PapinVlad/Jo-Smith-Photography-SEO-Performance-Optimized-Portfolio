This is a high-performance, SEO-centric landing page for a professional photographer based in Dundee. Unlike my previous projects, the main challenge here wasn't just "making it work," but making it rank high on search engines and provide a flawless user experience on any device or connection speed.


Structured Data (JSON-LD): I implemented Schema.org rich snippets (ProfessionalService). This tells Google exactly what the business is, its location (Dundee), and price range, which helps the site appear as a "rich result" in search.

Metadata Masterclass: I didn't just add a title; I implemented Open Graph (OG) and Twitter Card tags to ensure that when the site is shared on social media, it looks professional with the correct image and description.

Local SEO: I added specific Geo-tags (geo.position, geo.region) and a canonical URL to help the site dominate local search results in Scotland.

Performance Optimization: * I used WebP image formats and the loading="lazy" attribute for all non-hero images to keep the page size tiny.

I added preconnect links to external CDNs to reduce the Time to First Byte (TTFB).

Accessibility (A11y): I used semantic HTML (<main>, <nav>, <figure>) and ARIA roles to make sure the site is fully navigable for users with screen readers.


SEO is more than keywords: I learned that Google cares about performance and semantics as much as content. Using the right headers  and alt-tags isn't just for accessibility—it's for rankings.

The "Checkbox Hack" Revisited: I used the CSS-only hamburger menu again, but this time I focused on making it keyboard-accessible using aria-label and proper focus management.

Rich Snippets are Powerful: Seeing the site's data organized in a Google-friendly JSON-LD format made me realize how important "invisible" code is for the success of a business.
